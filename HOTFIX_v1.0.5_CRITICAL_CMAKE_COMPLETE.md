## Status: COMPLETED
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-13

## Critical Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ CMake Syntax Errors
- **Problem:** C-style comments `// filepath:` in CMake files
- **Solution:** Removed all C-style comments from all CMakeLists.txt files
- **Files Fixed:** 
  - `windows/CMakeLists.txt`
  - `windows/flutter/CMakeLists.txt` 
  - `windows/runner/CMakeLists.txt`
  - `windows/flutter/generated_plugins.cmake`

- **Problem:** `include could not find requested file: flutter/generated_plugins.cmake`
- **Solution:** Fixed path from `flutter/generated_plugins.cmake` to `../flutter/generated_plugins.cmake`
- **Location:** `windows/runner/CMakeLists.txt:44`

### 3. ✅ Install Files Error
- **Problem:** `install FILES given directory "" to install`
- **Solution:** Added safety check `if(PLUGIN_BUNDLED_LIBRARIES)` before install command
- **Location:** `windows/runner/CMakeLists.txt:75`

### 4. ✅ FLUTTER_TARGET_PLATFORM Warning
- **Problem:** "does not use FLUTTER_TARGET_PLATFORM, updating" warning
- **Solution:** Proper variable consumption with cache internal setting
- **Location:** All CMakeLists.txt files
